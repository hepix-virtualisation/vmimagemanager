# :formatFilter
# Formating the hard drive is faster than deleting 
# the content with ext3. XFS may be a better choice.

# formatFilter=mkfs.xfs %s

# Note default debian debootstrap comes with no xfs support in initrd.img.
# changing file system type to auto and installing the following files
#
#  apt-get install  xfsdump xfsprogs  attr dvhtool quota

# Allows supporting xfs/ext3 in debian.

# How do you want to format your hard drive
# By default the formatFilter filter can be set as
