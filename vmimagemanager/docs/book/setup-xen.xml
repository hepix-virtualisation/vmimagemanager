  <para>First time users are recommend getting virt-manager to work before I trying vmimagemanager. 
  virt-manager has a simple GUI for creating virtual maschines which has a dependacy upon libvirt, further it is
  available in fedora, and debian flavours of line so only a command line away.</para>

    <title>Tips on setting up &xen;</title>
    <para>
      In the area of virtualization and the amount of development work going on in this sector, 
      Always keep an eye on the latest release of all dependacies versions.

    <title>LVM Setup</title>
    <para>
      Which &xen; their are two modes of operation, paravirualization or full virtualization. 
      Paravirualization is faster but requires the kernels of the management domain and the 
      kernel of the &vm; to pass requests to each other. Paravirualization is a faster techinque for 
      virtualisation but has the disadvantage in that guests have to use modified kernels.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using paravirtualization in Xen you can also export only partitions without the 
      virtual maschine even having a disk, this is recomeneded if you have a paravirtualizable 
      client OS such as Linux, Solaris and maybe Plan9 Kernels. 2 Partitions are recomended 
      for parvitualized systems should have swap space for the Virtual Maschine's Virtual Memmory. 
      With Linux guests It changes the booting complications but provides an improved performance 
      since the hypovisor mearly gives access control.
    </para>
    <para>
      For exported partinion images each slot should have root=/dev/sbird/vm001sys swap=/dev/sbird/vm001swap 
      type attributes depending upon your virtulized host name and LVM vollume group.
    </para>
    <para>
      For exported disks each slot should have its attribute set so vmimagemanager knows which files system 
      to mount from the virtual disks. for a set of library images are loaded on two a set of slots. 
      You must decide how to organize this. I recommend buying some fresh large storage half a tera byte, 
      attached via SATA or better storeage infrastructure.
    </para>
    <para>    
      splinting the content 50/50 with space against running images, and create the partitions on demand 
      if you dont intend to uses as many images or less static images. If your intending running less .
      vmimagemanager works for maximum performance of linux virtualization hence supporting xen. This 
      allows the use of para-virtulization where the best performance exists currently although I have 
      not seen comparative data with solaris containers.
    </para>
    <para>
      At this moment Xen and 3d graphics and advanced graphics interactions has led to data loaded on 
      the screen, files system corruption and crashes. For this reason I suggest removing your login 
      manager (gdm, kdm , xdm) and shutting down X11 and using ssh to log into your xen server in 
      my case an ultra portable laptop with a large USB drive which is a little slow but to work on 
      my desktop is just wrong!.
